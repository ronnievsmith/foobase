### Installation & Usage

1. Create a Firebase project from the Firebase console.
1. Under the Overview section click on "Add Firebase to your web app".
   1. Paste these configuration parameters in `script.js`.
1. From the Firebase console, go to Authentication.
    1. Enable All forms of Authentication.
    1. Under the Templates Tab, remove `/__/auth/action` from the Action URL - we don't need it. 
    1. Keep the query parameters in the Action URL (the text after the ?).
1. Enable Firestore as your database.
    1. From the online console, add a new collection named `validator` and add a `field` `"secret"` with value of `"foo"`.
        1. This is going to be used for determining the privilege level of users. Our script will try and read this and if successful we know the user is an administrator.
    1. Paste the following rules into your `firestore.rules` file. NOTE: change the `uid` to your `uid`. Yours will be different. This is your administrator `uid` with write privileges.
```
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read,write: if request.auth.uid == "8FwcgfTAk6T6VOWmNWu5I47BI7g1";
    }
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /images {
      allow read;
    }
    match /quotes {
      allow read;
    }
  }
}
```
1. Enable Firebase Storage.
    1. Paste the following rules into your `storage.rules` file. NOTE: change the `uid` to your `uid.
```
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == "8FwcgfTAk6T6VOWmNWu5I47BI7g1";
    }
  }
}
```
1. Notice how the "Admin" section appears only for administrators?
1. Can you extend the app to have a multi-level admin? How about allowing users to vote on quotes or images?
